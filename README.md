HyperText Markup Language, or HTML:
Basis of Web Pages: The building blocks of HTML are used to create web pages. 
It describes the content and structural elements of a webpage, including headings, links, graphics, and text.
HTML is made up of elements, which are contained within opening and closing tags (like <p>, <h1>, and <img>), and attributes, which offer further information (such src for pictures and href for links).
Semantic Structure: Search engine optimisation and accessibility are improved by the semantic components that HTML5 introduced. These elements provide meaning about the material.<header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> are a few examples.
  
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Styling Web Pages: CSS is responsible for defining the visual appearance of HTML elements, controlling their layout, formatting, and overall presentation. 
It separates the content from the design, promoting maintainability and flexibility.
Selectors, Properties, and Values: CSS utilizes selectors to target specific HTML elements, properties to define style characteristics, and values to specify the desired appearance.
Cascading Rules: CSS follows a cascading mechanism, where styles from different sources (e.g., inline styles, embedded styles, external stylesheets) can override each other based on their specificity.
Responsive Design: CSS is indispensable for creating responsive web pages that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
Media queries enable conditional styling based on screen dimensions, device type, and other factors.

Important Ideas and Methods:
Box Model: To understand how items are arranged and placed on a page, one must be familiar with the box model. Content, padding, border, and margin make up its components.
Particularly for responsive design, these layout systems—Flexbox and Grid—offer strong and adaptable mechanisms for allocating items on a page.
Understanding colour theory makes it easier to choose colour schemes that are both aesthetically pleasing and approachable.
Typography: Selecting fonts, font sizes, and line spacing to produce legible and visually appealing writing is the understanding of typography.
Accessibility: Creating websites with people with disabilities in mind guarantees that they are usable by them. 
This entails using proper colour contrasts, semantic HTML, and alternate text for images.

Educational Materials:
Online Tutorials: Detailed tutorials and interactive exercises can be found on websites like W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and freeCodeCamp.
Books: Well-organised learning methods are offered by books like "Head First HTML5 and CSS" and "Responsive Web Design".
Practice Projects: Developing your own projects is a great method to put new knowledge and abilities into practice.
